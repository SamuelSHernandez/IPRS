# GC Division

>Note: one of the most useful design principles would be the "Liskov Substitution Principle" (LSP), which is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented programming. The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

## Sending division

The sending division is the base division of the individual being called.

## Calling division

The calling division is the host division where the ISE will serve.

## Host division

The host division is the division in which the ISE is serving. When referring to an entity as opposed to a territory, it also refers to GC institutions

<!--Why exactly do GC institutions get clustered with divisions? Is it a financial arangement, historical categorization? What is the benefit to doing so and how hard would it be to modularize these organizations while maintaining the infraestructure to support them?-->

### Country
The host division country is the country in the host division where the ISE is serving. There may be unusual situations where the ISE lives in a different country from the country in which he/she serves. In such cases, the ISE is normally paid in harmony with the rates and policies of the country where he/she lives.

### Country rate
The host division country rate is the remuneration and allowances an ISE or ISE employed spouse receives while serving in a particular country in the host division. It includes local salary, base country deposit (if any), expatriate allowance (if any), remuneration enhancement (if any), and any applicable local allowances for which an ISE would continue to have ongoing responsibility, such as automobile depreciation (if the ISE still owns an automobile), child allowance, compassionate leave (where applicable), and housing allowance (where applicable).
